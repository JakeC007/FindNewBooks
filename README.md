# Find New Books

This script works under the assumption that if an author's book has a missing year than it is unpublished or old--both things we are not interested in.

## Setup
1. If you are on ubuntu ensure that you are using `pip3` which can be installed with the command `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`
2. Install the following packages:
    - requests
    - xmltodict
3. Make the main python file executable by running the command `chmod u+x main.py`
4. At the root level of the directory fill in the file secrets.py

## TDD
- set up email
- send emails
- add function for other users to enter their USER ID and have an email be immediately sent 

# Future Notes:
- N/A
